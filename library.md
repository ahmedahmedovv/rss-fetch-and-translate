Top 10 - AI/ML/Data
1. BAML - domain-specific language for working with LLMs
BAML GitHub stars


Baml logo
As LLMs take center stage in modern AI workflows, the need to extract structured data efficiently, templatize complex prompts for reusability, and test them seamlessly has become critical. BAML meets this challenge head-on, offering a Developer Experience (DX) that sets a new standard.

BAML (Basically, A Made-up Language) introduces the concept of an LLM function, turning a simple prompt into a reusable, well-defined structure. An LLM function includes a prompt template with typed input variables —such as a string, integer, or object— and enforces a specific output type like a class, enum, union, or optional value. This level of specificity ensures outputs are always consistent and type-safe, making them easy to validate statically.

Written in Rust, BAML will generate code in Python, TypeScript or other languages, so you can call functions or use types from your projects. Calling an LLM feels as natural as calling any other function in your codebase, and with minimal boilerplate: the LLM-specific bits like prompts, clients and LLM hyperparameters all live outside of your Python code in easy to digest .baml modules. Here's how an LLM call to extract a structured resume from text would look like:

from baml_client.sync_client import b
from baml_client.types import Resume

def example(raw_resume: str) -> Resume:
  # BAML's internal parser guarantees ExtractResume
  # to be always return a Resume type
  response = b.ExtractResume(raw_resume)
  return response
Compared to frameworks like Pydantic or Zod, BAML is purpose-built for GenAI workflows, delivering faster iterations and higher accuracy. It also supports advanced features like streaming structured data, redundancy for LLM calls, and compatibility with multiple programming languages, making it a one-stop solution for prompt engineering. At the time of writing, BAML outperforms all other current methods of obtaining structured data (like JSON) from LLMs. This makes it a powerful tool for building scalable, reliable applications that leverage the strengths of LLMs, whether you’re using GPT-4o, Claude, or open-source alternatives.

Something I particularly appreciate about BAML is that it aims for full transparency: at every step, you know exactly what inputs are being fed into the LLM and what outputs are being generated, ensuring everything is under your direct control.

If you are using VS Code or Cursor, BAML seamlessly integrates to provide an exceptional development experience. With features like real-time prompt previews, syntax highlighting, and an interactive playground, you can edit and test your prompts directly in your IDE. The integration allows you to validate outputs, iterate quickly, and visualize your prompt logic as you go. This tight coupling makes BAML a natural choice for developers looking to streamline their LLM workflows while maintaining precision and type safety.
